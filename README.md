# MovieBlog-CMS

This is a Sample Blog Content Management System Created with JavaScript, Bootstrap, etc.
For Database I added SQL relational database which connected using JSON based Rest API.

This Blog is about movies. You can add move Title, Category, and Blog description to database and visitors can read them.

From this project I learnt about Rest API and how it works and many more things. 

Database Backup File and CMS Login Credintials are included inside if you needed.
